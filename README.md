# Onboarding Management Platform

## Overview

The **Onboarding Management Platform** is a web-based service designed to help companies manage the onboarding process for new employees. The platform allows companies to:

- Register and manage company data.
- Add and manage multiple teams.
- Assign onboarding processes to teams.
- Track the onboarding status of designated workers.

The project is built using a combination of **Java (JDBC)** for the backend and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend. It follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns and easy maintainability.

## Features

- **Company Dashboard**: Overview of processes, teams, and workers.
- **Team Dashboard**: Information about the team, assigned onboarding process, and designated workers.
- **Process Dashboard**: Overview of processes assigned to teams.
- **Add/Edit Forms**: Interfaces for adding new teams, processes, and workers.
- **User Authentication**: Admin login for managing company data and users.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: 
  - Java (JDBC) for database management
  - Servlets for routing requests
  - Models and Services for business logic
  - MySQL (or similar SQL databases) for data storage
- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML/CSS for layout and styling
  - JavaScript for frontend logic and AJAX requests
  - No frameworks (pure vanilla JS)
- **Version Control**: Git for versioning and team collaboration

### Backend

- **/controllers**: Java servlets to handle incoming API requests.
- **/models**: Data entities such as `User`, `Team`, `Process`, etc.
- **/services**: Business logic for processing requests (e.g., creating teams, assigning processes).
- **/utils**: Helper utilities, such as DB connections.
- **/config**: Configuration files for the database and app settings.

### Frontend

- **/assets/js**: JavaScript files for managing AJAX requests and frontend logic.
- **/assets/css**: CSS files for styling.
- **/views**: HTML files for rendering the dashboard and form pages.
- **/controllers**: Frontend controllers to handle UI logic and communication with the backend.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the project, ensure the following dependencies and tools are installed:

### Backend:

- **Java 8+**: Java Development Kit for running the backend code.
- **Apache Tomcat or similar Servlet container**: To run Java servlets.
- **MySQL (or similar SQL database)**: For storing company, team, process, and worker data.
- **JDBC**: For database communication.

### Frontend:

- **Web Browser**: For viewing and interacting with the web application.
- **Text Editor or IDE**: For coding (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA).

### Tools:

- **Git**: Version control system for collaboration and code management.
- **Maven/Gradle (optional)**: For managing backend dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd OnboardingManagementPlatform
   ```

2. **Run the bash script to create the project structure**:

   ```bash
   bash setup_project.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Database**:
   - Set up a MySQL (or any SQL-compatible database).
   - Create a database (e.g., `onboarding_db`).
   - Update the `dbConfig.java` file with your database credentials.

4. **Run the Backend**:
   - Compile the Java servlets and deploy them on **Apache Tomcat** or another servlet container.
   - Make sure the Tomcat server is running and accessible on the default port (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

5. **Run the Frontend**:
   - Open the HTML files in a browser (they will call the API endpoints you set up in the backend).
   - Use a local server or open them directly in your browser.

6. **Start working on your assigned tasks**:
   - Each team member is assigned to a specific part of the project (backend or frontend).
   - Follow the MVC architecture, ensuring proper separation of concerns between the data (models), business logic (services), and user interface (views).

## API Endpoints

Here are some of the basic API endpoints for the backend:

### User Endpoints

- **POST** `/login`: User login
- **POST** `/register`: Create a new company user

### Team Endpoints

- **GET** `/teams`: Get list of all teams
- **POST** `/teams`: Create a new team
- **PUT** `/teams/{teamId}`: Update team information
- **DELETE** `/teams/{teamId}`: Delete a team

### Process Endpoints

- **GET** `/processes`: Get list of all processes
- **POST** `/processes`: Create a new process
- **PUT** `/processes/{processId}`: Update a process
- **DELETE** `/processes/{processId}`: Delete a process

### Company Endpoints

- **GET** `/company`: Get company information
- **PUT** `/company`: Update company information
